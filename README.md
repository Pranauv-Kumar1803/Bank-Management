# Bank-Management
Hello ðŸ‘‹! This is my first big project that I took on my own to do with Nodejs,MongoDB,Express and EJS.
Here, I have used local MongoDb Database for my project.
This is a basic application where there are Bank account holders who can Make Transactions, View their Transactions in the past 30 Days or in the past 2 months from the
date they are accessing it, Download their transactions ( similar - past 1 month or past 2 months ), Change their profile ( name,password,address,etc ), Close their 
bank account by confirming with their user password.
This also includes employee login and stuff like viewing list of customers and searching customers/Logout

I have also implemented a little bit of authentication and security with the help of cookies in the website and through the same, tried to implement session-like
experience for the user and the employee.
